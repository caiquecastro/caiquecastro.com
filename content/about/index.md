title: About
---

Hello, my name is Caique de Castro. I'm 31 and I hold a degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Taubaté
(UNITAU) and an MBA in Soluctions Architect from FIAP. Based in Taubaté, SP, Brazil, I work as a senior software engineer.

My journey in programming began at the age of 12, when I started building websites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
Back then, I coded in Dreamweaver and experimented with Flash animations—early experiences that sparked my passion
for technology and problem-solving.

Today, I focus on designing and developing scalable software solutions. My interests include modern web technologies,
cloud architecture, distributed systems, and continuously exploring better ways to build impactful digital products.
