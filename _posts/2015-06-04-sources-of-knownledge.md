Hey guys, today I'm going to write about my sources of knownledge. I like to read many articles related to development daily. I follow many blogs and I'm subscribed in many newsletters and I also follow interesting profiles in Twitter.

[DevDocs](http://devdocs.io) is a website that combine at the moment I'm writing this post more than fifty API docs. It has a nice interface, the docs are very organized, and the search box helps us to find a specific documentation.

Although DevDocs offers PHP Documentation, I still look for some things in [PHP.net](http://php.net/), when it comes to my favorite programming language.
